  sentences:
  - Hey, I just wanted to tell you...
  - I know I practically begged you for some<#f94032><b> tomatoes</b></color> when
    you arrived.
  - And I'm sorry I've been so shameless.
  - "I finally decided to buy TOMAGA\xA9 tomatoes, tomatoes that change your life!"
  - I signed an exclusivity contract with them. They'll supply me for at least five
    years.
  - So... I can't accept your help anymore.
  - I hope your farming activity works out for you.
