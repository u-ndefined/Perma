  sentences:
  - Hello, I kept thinking about your kindness and...
  - '...Let me give you something. Not because I owe you anything... But as a gift
    to you.'
  - "It's my uncle\u2019s old axe. Now, don't be fooled by its age: the older they
    are the more... Trustworthy? I guess?"
  - That's what my uncle used to say when I was a little boy anyway.
  - He was a farmer, like you.
  - I remember him cutting wood with this axe and burying the wood into the soil before
    planting his seeds.
  - He told me the decomposing wood could keep a plant's roots warm all winter.
  - "\u2026I hope it will be useful to you. And thanks again. For the<#f94032><b>
