  - Hello there! I hope I'm not disturbing your work.
  - I'm Gilbert, I own a shop in town.

  - It must be nice to grow your own vegetables...
  - I've been trying to get my hands on<#f94032><b> ten tomatoes</b></color> for weeks
    now!
  - The local farmers prefer to cultivate other, easier species...
  - I could always try to buy some from one of the big distributors, but they won't

  - Oh! I'm sorry if I started rambling about myself.
