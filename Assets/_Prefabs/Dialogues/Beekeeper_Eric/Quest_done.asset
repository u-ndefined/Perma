  sentences:
  - Ah, you managed to grow those<#f9ae06><b> ten carrots</b></color> all by yourself?
    Well done Greeny!
  - Here, ten tomato seeds bags. A promise is a promise after all.
  - I'm happy, I had those seeds for a long time but, growing things is kinda not
    my thing, you know?
  - And I couldn't give them to someone without any skills who would let them go to
    waste.
  - You see,<#f9ae06><b> tomatoes</b></color> are hard to grow, they need a lot of
    energy and a rich soil to develop properly...
  - At least that's what the back of the bag said, ha ha!
