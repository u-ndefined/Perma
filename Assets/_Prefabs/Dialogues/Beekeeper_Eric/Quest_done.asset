  - Ah, you managed to grow those<#f9ae06><b> ten carrots</b></color> all by yourself?
    Well done Greeny!
  - You are now worthy enough for those ten tomato seeds bags.
  - But be careful!
  - You see,<#f9ae06><b> tomatoes</b></color> are hard to grow, they need an energy
    rich soil to develop properly...
  - At least that's what the back of the bag said, ah ha!
  - Oh! And if you ever mess something up, use this shovel to remove any dead plant.
