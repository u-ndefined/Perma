  sentences:
  - So, why did you decide to leave the city for this practically dead town?
  - Me? You wouldn't know it by looking at me now but I used to work in the marketing
    department of a big brand.
  - And when I say big, I mean BIG big.
  - One day... I don't know, I just had enough of everything and... Well, here I am.
