  sentences:
  - Hey! You here to buy some honey? It's handmade, organic and gluten-free. I'm sure
    you'll love it!
  - "\u2026What? You just moved here? Oh! I think I heard the mayor talking about
    you."
  - Well, I'm Eric, best beekeeper in the area! It's nice to meet you!
  - I've only been in this town myself for six months, but I can still be helpful
    if you need anything.
  - Speaking about help, did you bring any seeds with you to start your little farm?
  - Well, if you didn't... don't fret! For I have in my possession ten tomato seeds
    bags!
  - And I'll trade them with you for... Uhm... Let's say...<#f9ae06><b> Ten carrots</b></color>!
  - "Just\u2026 Please don't talk to anyone about this. OK?"
  - I don't think we're supposed to trade seeds outside of the official market circuit.
