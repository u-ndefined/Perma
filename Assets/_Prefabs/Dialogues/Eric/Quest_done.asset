  sentences:
  - Ah, you managed to grow those ten carrots all by yourself? Well done Greeny!
  - Here, ten tomato seeds bags, just as promised. A promise is a promise after all.
  - I guess I'm kind happy, I had those seeds but, growing things is kinda not my
    thing, you know?And I couldn't give them to someone without any skills who would
    let them go to waste.
  - And I couldn't give them to someone without any skills who would let them go to
    waste.
  - You see, tomatoes are hard to grow, they need a lot of energy and a rich soil
    to develop properly... at least that's what the back of the bag said, ha ha!
