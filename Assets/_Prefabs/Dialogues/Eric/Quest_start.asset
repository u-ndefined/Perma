  sentences:
  - Hey! You here to buy some honey? It's handmade, organic and gluten-free. I'm sure
    you'll love it!
  - "\u2026 What? You just moved here? Oh! I think I heard the mayor talking about
    you. You're\u2026 uhm... ah, a farmer, right?"
  - Well, I'm Eric, best beekeeper in the area! It's nice to meet you! I've only been
    in this town myself for six months, but I can still be helpful if you need anything.
  - Talking about help, have you brought any seeds with you to start your little farm?
    I heard those are hard to come by these days.
  - Well, if you didn't... don't fret! For I have in my possession ten tomato seeds
    bags! And I'll trade them to you for... uhm... let's say... ten carrots!
  - It seems like a fair trade to me, generous even.
  - "Just\u2026 please don't talk to anyone about this, I think we're not supposed
    to trade seeds outside of the official market circuit. OK?"
