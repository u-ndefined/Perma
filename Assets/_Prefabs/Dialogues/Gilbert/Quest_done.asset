  sentences:
  - Is... Is that... tomatoes you have here? Plump, juicy tomatoes? All twenty of
    them?
  - And you're giving them to me? I... That's very kind of you.
  - Let me give you something. Not because I owe you something... but as a gift to
    you.
  - "It's my uncle\u2019s old axe. Now, don't be fooled by its age : the older they
    are the more... trustworthy? I guess?"
  - That's what my uncle used to say when I was a little boy anyway.
  - He was a farmer, like you. I remember him cutting wood with this axe and burying
    the wood into the soil before planting his seeds.
  - He told me the decomposing wood could keep a plant's roots warm all winter.
  - "\u2026 I hope it will be useful to you. And thanks again. For the tomatoes I
    mean."
