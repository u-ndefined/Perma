  sentences:
  - Hello there! I hope I'm not disturbing your work, but when I heard there was a
    new face in town, I couldn't help but come to welcome you myself.
  - "I'm Gilbert, I own a shop in town. It's\u2026 well, quite modest. But what I
    lack I size, I make up with good conversation."
  - Or at the very least, I try...
  - Anyway! I heard you were going to farm on this plot of land? That's brave of you,
    the soil is not very fertile around here.
  - I would know, I've been trying to get my hands on just twenty tomatoes for weeks
    now!
  - The local farmers prefer other, easier species... I could always try to buy some
    from one of the big distributors, but they won't give me a fair price...
  - '*SIGH*'
  - Oh! I'm sorry if I started rambling about myself.
  - Well, I have to go back to work. But if you need anything, anything at all, don't
    hesitate to come. And again, welcome!
