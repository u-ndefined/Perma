  sentences:
  - Hey, wanna know a secret?
  - Well, everyone knows it, but nobody wants to talk about it...
  - The mayor has a brother that lives somewhere in the forest.
  - He used to live in the village and help out at the townhall.
  - But one day, he just sort of became crazy.
  - '"I''m telling you I''m a robot!", "I can''t live with normal humans!" Creepy,
    right?'
  - Since that day, he lives in the forest.
  - And the mayor rarely comes out anymore.
  - '............This place is so weird.'
