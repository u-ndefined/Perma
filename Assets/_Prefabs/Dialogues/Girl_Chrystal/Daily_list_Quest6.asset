  sentences:
  - When we met, I told you to call me Chris.
  - You must have guessed it but it's just a nickname.
  - My real name is so weird and lame, I don't even want to say it.
  - '...'
  - It's "Chrystal".
  - Argh! It's so bad!
  - '...But it''s the name chosen by my mom, so I can''t abandon it completely.'
  - So, "Chris" it is.
